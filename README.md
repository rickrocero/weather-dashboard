# weather-dashboard

## Description


* My motivation was to build a weather web application that dynamically updates the HTML based on user input using the server-side API called OpenWeather API.

* I built this project for travelers who want to check the current weather and see the 5-day forecast of their city destination so that they can plan their trip accordingly. 

* This weather dashboard solves the problem a prospective traveler may have in a case where they do not what weather to expect and want to be dressed according to the weather and they want to plan an activity on days when the weather conditions are favorable. 

* I learned how to use JavaScript to extract particular data from a server-side API and dynamically render that data onto the page for the user to see in the form of a weather dashboard.
